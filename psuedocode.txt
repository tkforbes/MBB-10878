load config file (YAML), storing list of excluded users.

get list of users and their uid, gid from system.

reduce that list, removing any excluded users (described by config file YAML).

ask AD for a list of user details, using reduced users list as a filter.

compare user's attributes of the system list to user's attributes of the AD list.
  
depending on nature of the difference or match, an individual user's details belong on one of three reports
    matching - user name, uid, gid, email
    non-matching - user name, system uid, AD uid, system gid, AD gid, AD email
    unmatched - system user name
